Guided Access is an iOS feature that locks your device to a single app, preventing children from exiting or accessing other features. This is the **recommended way** to use Baby Play Pad for maximum security.

1. In Guided Access settings, tap **Passcode Settings**

- Enable Display Auto-Lock in Guided Access settings
- Set a time limit if desired
- Start Guided Access
- Device will alert when time is up

**Scenario 3: Multiple Children**

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Start Guided Access
- Make sure it's enabled in Settings → Accessibility

### Forgot Guided Access Passcode
- You'll need to reset it:
  1. Go to Settings → Accessibility → Guided Access
  2. Tap Passcode Settings

## Alternative: Without Guided Access

- Enter 4-digit PIN to confirm
- This provides basic protection but is less secure than Guided Access

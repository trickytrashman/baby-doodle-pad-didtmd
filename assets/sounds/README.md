# Sound Files

This app requires three sound effect files:

1. **giggle.mp3** - A baby giggle sound
2. **chime.mp3** - A pleasant chime sound
3. **pop.mp3** - A bubble pop sound

## Where to get sounds:

You can download free sound effects from:
- https://freesound.org/
- https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/
- https://www.zapsplat.com/

## Instructions:

1. Download or create three short sound effect files (MP3 format)
2. Name them: `giggle.mp3`, `chime.mp3`, and `pop.mp3`
3. Place them in the `assets/sounds/` directory
4. Each file should be under 1 second for best performance

## Temporary Solution:

If you don't have sound files yet, the app will still work but won't play sounds. You can add them later.
